## Installation

Before running the project, make sure to install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Notes:
## TextToVoice:
- need to download and place the files ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe, ffprobe.exe in main directory
otherwise the TTS will fail to translate text to voice due to windows not finding the exe files to use
